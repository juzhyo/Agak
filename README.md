# Introduction
> Nothing is more inaccurate yet precise than agaration.

Agaration is an in-house program written to add spatial photocurrent mapping capability 
to our optical setup. The measurement involves controlling a laser's position on a device 
through a galvo mirror system, and reading its current/voltage output. In time, it is hoped 
that it can perform temperature-, wavelength-, and bias-dependent mappings as well. A GUI 
unifies the measurement system and allows monitoring of the orchestra of instruments that 
are working together.

# Features
- Software control of SR830 settings
- Live time trace of SR830 channels
- Spatial photocurrent mapping
- Visual update of mapping progression


# Instruments
+ SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier
+ M Squared SolsTiS
+ Custom galvo mirror system
+ Agilent B2902A sourcemeter
+ Thorlabs PM100D power meter


# Roadmap
> I tried carrying the weight of the world\
> But I only have two hands

Agaration is very much still a work-in-progress. Hopefully more functions 
will be added soon. Some of the functions that are in consideration are:

+ Live laser positioning control
+ Custom saving directory
+ Wavelength-dependent measurement
+ Live camera capture
+ Bias-dependent mapping with sourcementer
